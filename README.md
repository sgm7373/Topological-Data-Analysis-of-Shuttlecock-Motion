# 🏸 Topological Data Analysis of Shuttlecock Motion

This project investigates shuttlecock bounce dynamics using **Finite Element Method (FEM)** simulations and **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**—with a focus on **Persistent Homology**.

The study explores how variations in **material stiffness**, **damping**, **friction**, **geometry**, and **shuttle type** influence bounce height and stabilization time.
