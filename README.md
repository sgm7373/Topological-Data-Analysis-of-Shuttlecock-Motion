# Topological-Data-Analysis-of-Shuttlecock-Motion
Explores shuttlecock bounce dynamics using FEM simulations and Topological Data Analysis (Persistent Homology). Analyzes how stiffness, damping, friction, and shape affect bounce height and stabilization. Includes Python code for persistence diagrams and 3D visualizations to uncover hidden topological patterns.
